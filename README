Flagship Responsive Web Development
===================================


The Flagship_RWD repository is a collaborative project 
to mature the layout of adventist.org to a competitive standard. 

What exists currently is a template which is being refined 
for usage as a third version of adventist.org. Upon reaching a point, 
it will then expand to contain transitional versions between 2.0 and 3.0, 
introducing changes without disorienting users.

Upon completion, we will release the repository to the public for 
the expressed intent of providing a functional, attractive template
at no cost to all interested in developing sites for Adventist entities 
and organizations. Additionally, this release we hope will encourage
open source development of Adventist online presence from the 
headquarters to the individual church member.
